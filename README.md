# Banking System (OOP Practice)

A simple banking system implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
This project is created strictly for practice to simulate real-world banking logic and improve system design skills.

---

## Objective

* Practice Object-Oriented Programming in Python
* Understand real-world system modeling
* Improve class design and interaction logic

---

## Concepts Used

* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Method-level interactions

---

## Features

* Create bank accounts
* Deposit and withdraw money
* Transfer money between accounts
* Check account balance
* Basic validations

---

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Notes

* This is a practice-focused project
* No database, UI, or external libraries
* Emphasis is on clean OOP logic, not production use

---

## Future Improvements

* Transaction history
* Better exception handling
* Persistent storage
* Unit testing
* Command-line or GUI interface
